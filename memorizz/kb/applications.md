# MemoRizz Real-World Applications and Use Cases

## Industry Applications

### 1. Customer Support and Service Automation

**Persistent Customer Context:**
- Agents remember customer preferences, previous issues, and interaction history
- Semantic knowledge base for product information and troubleshooting
- Multi-agent coordination between different support tiers

**Implementation Example:**
```python
# Customer service agent with persistent memory
support_agent = MemAgent(
    model=OpenAI(model="gpt-4"),
    instruction="You are a helpful customer support agent with access to customer history.",
    memory_provider=memory_provider,
    application_mode=ApplicationMode.ASSISTANT
)

# Add customer interaction to memory
support_agent.add_long_term_memory(
    "Customer John Smith prefers email communication and has issues with billing module",
    namespace="customer_profiles"
)

# Multi-session continuity
response = support_agent.run("What was John's last issue?")  # Remembers previous context
```

**Business Impact:**
