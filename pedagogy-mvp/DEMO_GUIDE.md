# 🎓 Pedagogy Learning System - Demo Guide

## Overview
A comprehensive learning system that captures and visualizes your learning journey with Claude, tracking knowledge gaps and progress through interactive knowledge graphs.

## 🚀 Quick Start Demo

### 1. Launch the System
```bash
cd /Users/wz/Desktop/zPersonalProjects/long_context_pedagogy/pedagogy-mvp
node server.js
```
Open: http://localhost:3001

### 2. Quick Validation
Run the validation script to ensure everything is working:
```bash
./quick_demo_test.sh
```

### 3. Interactive Demo Scenarios

#### Scenario A: Machine Learning Infrastructure Learning
```bash
# Navigate to ml-infra workspace
cd ml-infra

# Start learning session
claude -p "I want to learn about MLOps pipelines. What should I know first?"

# Follow-up question
claude -p "How do I set up CI/CD for machine learning models?"

# Advanced topic
claude -p "What are the best practices for ML model versioning?"
```

#### Scenario B: Deep Learning Fundamentals
```bash
# Navigate to ml-systems workspace  
cd ml-systems

# Beginner session
claude -p "I'm completely new to deep learning. Can you assess my knowledge and guide me?"

# Progressive learning
claude -p "I understand basics now. Teach me about backpropagation."

# Advanced concepts
claude -p "How do transformers work? I want to understand the attention mechanism."
```

#### Scenario C: Resume Learning Session
```bash
# Continue from previous session
claude -p --resume "session-id-here" "I want to go deeper into the topic we discussed."
```

## 🖥️ UI Features Demonstration

### Real-Time Dashboard
1. **Workspace Selector**: Switch between learning topics
2. **Knowledge Graphs**: Visual representation of Claude's and your knowledge
3. **Learning Profile**: Track goals, progress, and preferences  
4. **Activity Stream**: Real-time conversation capture

### Interactive Controls
- **Graph Zoom**: 🔍+ / 🔍- buttons
- **Graph Reset**: ↻ button
- **Fullscreen**: ⛶ button (ESC to exit)
- **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 5 seconds

## 📊 System Monitoring

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

### API Endpoints
- `/workspaces` - Available learning workspaces
- `/events?workspace=ml-infra` - Learning activity for workspace
- `/kb/claude-graph?workspace=ml-infra` - Claude's knowledge graph
- `/kb/user-graph?workspace=ml-infra` - User's knowledge graph
- `/kb/user-profile?workspace=ml-infra` - Learning profile

## 🎯 Demo Talking Points

### Problem Solved
- **Learning Gap Visibility**: See what you know vs what Claude knows
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual representation of learning journey
- **Context Switching**: Multiple workspaces for different topics
- **Session Continuity**: Resume conversations with full context

### Technical Innovation
- **Real-time Event Capture**: Hook-based Claude CLI integration
- **Dynamic Knowledge Graphs**: Mermaid.js visualization
- **Workspace Isolation**: Separate learning contexts
- **Production-Ready**: Comprehensive error handling and monitoring

### User Experience
- **Professional UI**: Glass-morphism design with gradients
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Interactive Elements**: Zoomable, fullscreen graphs
- **Status Indicators**: Real-time connection status

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Components
1. **Express.js Server**: REST API with SQLite database
2. **Event Capture System**: Python hooks for Claude CLI
3. **Knowledge Base**: Mermaid graph files per workspace
4. **Web Interface**: Real-time dashboard with auto-refresh

### Data Flow
```
Claude CLI → capture_events.py → SQLite DB → REST API → Web UI
           ↓
    Knowledge Files → File System → REST API → Graph Visualization
```

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Comprehensive end-to-end test
./test_learning_journey.sh

# Quick validation
./quick_demo_test.sh
```
