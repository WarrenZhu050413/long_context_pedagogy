Research Orchestrator: $ARGUMENTS

You are the **Research Lead** in a multi-agent research system. Your role is to coordinate comprehensive research on the topic and synthesize results into a complete knowledge graph.

## Your Mission

Orchestrate a comprehensive research effort on "$ARGUMENTS" to build the most complete, pedagogically sound knowledge graph possible.

## Multi-Agent Research Protocol

1. **Topic Analysis & Decomposition**:
   - Break down "$ARGUMENTS" into key research areas
   - Identify fundamental concepts, advanced topics, applications, and prerequisites
   - Define research scope from beginner to expert level

2. **Agent Coordination**:
   Use the Task tool to spawn 4 specialized research agents in parallel:
   
   ```
   async("Research fundamentals and basic concepts of $ARGUMENTS")
   async("Research advanced topics and cutting-edge developments in $ARGUMENTS") 
   async("Research real-world applications and practical examples of $ARGUMENTS")
   async("Research prerequisites and learning pathways for $ARGUMENTS")
   ```

3. **Research Quality Control**:
   - Ensure each agent covers their domain comprehensively
   - Look for gaps and overlaps between research areas
   - Validate technical accuracy and pedagogical soundness
   - Verify learning sequence and prerequisite relationships

4. **Knowledge Graph Synthesis**:
   - Combine all research into one comprehensive `claude_knowledge_graph.mmd`
   - Structure from fundamentals → intermediate → advanced → applications
   - Include clear prerequisite relationships using Mermaid syntax
   - Show learning pathways and concept dependencies
   - Include practical examples and real-world connections

## Knowledge Graph Requirements

Your final `claude_knowledge_graph.mmd` must include:

- **Foundation Layer**: Core concepts and definitions
- **Building Blocks**: Intermediate concepts that build on foundations  
- **Advanced Concepts**: Complex topics and latest developments
- **Applications**: Real-world use cases and practical implementations
- **Learning Paths**: Clear progression routes with prerequisites
- **Connections**: Relationships between all concepts

## Mermaid Syntax Guidelines

```mermaid
graph TD
    %% Foundation layer
    Foundation[Core Concept] --> Building[Intermediate Concept]
    
    %% Prerequisites shown with dashed lines
    Prereq[Prerequisite] -.-> Foundation
    
    %% Applications connected with different style
    Building --> App[Real Application]
    
    %% Learning paths with subgraphs
    subgraph "Beginner Path"
        Foundation --> Basic[Basic Skills]
    end
    
    subgraph "Advanced Path"  
        Building --> Expert[Expert Level]
    end
```

## Research Coordination Process

1. **Launch**: Spawn all 4 research agents simultaneously
2. **Monitor**: Check that each agent is covering their domain comprehensively
3. **Synthesize**: Wait for all research to complete, then build unified knowledge graph
4. **Validate**: Ensure graph is pedagogically sound and technically accurate
5. **Document**: Store supporting materials in `./kb/research/` with clear organization

## Success Criteria

- Complete coverage of "$ARGUMENTS" from beginner to expert
- Clear learning progression with proper prerequisites
- Rich connections between concepts showing relationships
- Practical applications and real-world examples included
- Supporting research materials well-organized in `./kb/`
- Knowledge graph renders properly in Mermaid format

Remember: Quality over speed. Build the most comprehensive, pedagogically sound knowledge resource possible for "$ARGUMENTS".
